Wandledi
========

Wandledi is an HTML transformation library which provides an alternative to
'traditional' templating in web programming.
The core is Java, however, a Scala API is available, too.

Wandledi may be used in web applications through Wandlet,
which is a library for using Wandledi in Servlet API based applications.
